Tailspin
========

Tailspin is a fully reversible Javascript interpreter written in Javascript. It is almost fully standards-compliant and is written in continuation passing style which allows the interpretation of code to be paused and controlled.

Tailspin is based on the [Narcissus](https://github.com/mozilla/narcissus) Javascript interpreter.

It was built to provide the basis for interesting web-based programming explorations, visualisations and puzzles.

ES5.1 Compliance
---------------

Tailspin currently passes 99.9% of the [ECMAScript Language test262](http://test262.ecmascript.org/) test suite.

Reversibility
------------

Tailspin is able to run in a reversible mode, where state changes are recorded so that they can be undone, compared to the non-revsersible mode this is slightly slower and uses more memory.

In reversible mode almost all state changes can be undone. Some state changes such as `Object.freeze()` and `Object.seal()` are not reversible as Tailspin uses the host runtime's Javascript objects and the effect of these functions is permanent.

Sandboxing
----------

Tailspin utilises the host's Javascript object implementations and thus polluting the host environment is possible. However when running in a browser, tailspin creates an isolated `iframe` to provide sandboxed object implementations.

Usage
-----

Basic usage for creating an interpreter and running the string `source`:

```js
var tailspin = new Tailspin.Interpreter();

// Create an evaluation context that describes the how the code is to be executed.
var x = tailspin.createExecutionContext();

// Run the code.
tailspin.evaluateInContext(source, "console", 0, x, function(result) {
    console.log(result);
}, function(result) {
    console.error(result);
}, null);
```
